ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Interactive and dynamic charts can be intimidating, but they shouldn't be.

In today's world, many people work hard to create amazing open-source and free tools, and interactive charts are no exception!

## Folium: dynamic maps made easy

Folium is a Python library based on Leaflet. Since Leaflet was built using JavaScript (JS), it's natively interactive, and its developers have made it very easy to create maps similar to what Google Maps looks like.

Folium developers took this JS library and wrapped it with Python code so that you only need to write a little Python to create incredible maps!

## In practice

Check out this code sample:

```python
import folium
my_map = folium.Map()
my_map
```

If you run this in a Jupyter notebook, that's all you need to create your very first Folium map!

You can also easily save the map in HTML format and place it anywhere you like (your portfolio, a dedicated website, etc).

```python
my_map.save("map.html")
```

## Advanced use case

Even though the library has lightweight syntax, you have access to a high level of customization! Here's what you can do in 30 lines of code:

[Video of map with earthquakes would be inserted here]

[Button to view code would be inserted here]

See you tomorrow with a new tip!
