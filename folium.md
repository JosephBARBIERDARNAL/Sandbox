ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

Interactive and dynamic charts can be intimidating, but they shouldnâ€™t.

In todayâ€™s world, there are so many people that work hard to create open source and free amazing tools, and interactive charts are not an exception!

## Folium: dynamic maps made easy

Folium is a python library based on Leaflet. Since Leaflet was built using JavaScript (JS), itâ€™s natively interactive and its developers have made it very easy to create maps similar to what Google Maps look like.
â€‹â€‹

Folium developers took this JS library and wrapped it around some Python code so that you just need to do a little bit of Python to create incredible maps!

## In practice

Check this code sample:

```python
import folium
my_map = folium.Map()
my_map
```
â€‹
If you run this in a jupyter notebook, this is only what you need to create your very first folium map!

You can also easily save the map in HTML format:

```python
my_map.save("map.html")
```

## Advanced use case

Even though the library has a light-weight syntax, you have access to a high customization level! Here what you can do in 30 lines of code:
